    /** This stream offers basic filtering capability.
      * It hooks up in front of another stream and filters the messages that are passed to it
      * with respect to the given configuration.
      * Filtering is based on using matching of the issue's function name and qualifiers with
      * the given regular expressions. A stream configuration is composed of the stream name,
      * that is "rfilter", followed by brackets with a comma separated list
      * of regular expressions, where any expression can be preceded by an exclamation mark.
      * For example:
      *  \li rfilter(create.*,new.*) - this stream will pass messages that have originated
      *         from a function that starts with either "create" or "new" string.
      *  \li rfilter(!create.*,!new.*) - this stream will pass messages that have originated
      *         from a function that starts with neither "create" nor "new" string.
      *
